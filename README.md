# dogTinder

Mimicking the popular social media application Tinder, DogTinder was a class assignment that replaced human users with dog users. The mobile app allows users (dogs) to like or dislike other users (dogs) and search for a possible playmate. 

Following the concepts taught in the [HeadFirst Android Development Book](https://www.amazon.com/Head-First-Android-Development-Brain-Friendly/dp/1449362184) I applied it to this final project.
